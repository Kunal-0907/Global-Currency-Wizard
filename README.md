# Global Currency Wizard üåç

A responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to convert currencies in real-time using the ExchangeRate API. The application is designed with a modern UI and supports dynamic flag updates, currency swapping, and real-time exchange rates.

## Features

- **Real-Time Currency Conversion**: Fetches live exchange rates from the ExchangeRate API.
- **Currency Swapping**: Easily switch between "From" and "To" currencies.
- **Dynamic Flag Updates**: Displays country flags for selected currencies.
- **Optional Date Picker**: Allows selecting a date for historical rates (future enhancement).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for fetching exchange rates and updating the UI.
- **npm & live-server**: For local development and automatic browser refresh.

## Project Setup

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd currency-converter
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash

   ```
   This will start the project locally using `live-server`.

## How It Works
